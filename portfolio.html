            <h2>Building Computers</h2>
            <p>Building my PC was an exciting and rewarding experience that combined problem-solving, research, and hands-on work. I started by carefully choosing each component—CPU, GPU, motherboard, RAM, storage, power supply, and case—making sure everything was compatible and suited to my needs, whether for gaming, productivity, or both. Once all the parts arrived, I laid them out and began the assembly process, starting with installing the CPU and cooler onto the motherboard, followed by the RAM and storage. Placing the motherboard into the case and connecting all the cables took patience and attention to detail, especially when managing wires for a clean build. After everything was connected, the moment of truth came when I powered it on for the first time—and seeing the system boot up properly was incredibly satisfying. Building my PC not only gave me a deeper understanding of how computers work but also gave me a custom machine tailored perfectly to my needs.</p>
